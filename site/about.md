## SYNOPSIS

Describes the motivation behind this site.

## BACKGROUND

After suffering a period of tech burnout, I wanted to get back to a
point where I was happy and excited to do technical work. One of the
things I always wanted to do was to get into kernel development. For
a litany of reasons, I ended up with illumos. For the first time, I
was excited to do technical things; my first dive into the kernel was
the first time in over a year that I wrote a serious (albeit short)
[technical blog post](http://kyleisom.net/blog/2016/09/17/illumos-processes/)
and indeed, a weekend doing something technical.

I'd previously had a site for Unix programming, but it was more from the
perspective of a systems programmer. It included projects I'd done like
writing a webserver or a secure file removal tool. I stole this site's
styling from that site, though this site is aimed more at implementations
of Unix.

## DESCRIPTION

With this in mind, I have a new goal: end up as an illumos kernel
developer. To that end, I've started this site for collecting notes
on things. The longer and more developed posts may end up on my main
blog.

The idea is to force an understanding of things by writing about them.
A written exposition of a technical subject requires a fundamental
understanding of the subject.
